# Thermocon Example
Using the low-power memory LCD, the following sensors are measured and shown:

* Temperature (SHT35)
* Relative humidity (SHT35)

The device sleeps for 10 seconds, measures, updates LCD and goes back to sleep. It is
also possible to increase and decrease the preset temperatur shot on the top of the LCD.
